# CWNOS Dashboard Userstories

Let's collect and prioritize user stories. User stories help to target
development and create an end-product that suits the need of users better.

If you are not familiar with user stories, read the [wikipedia
article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) it gives a good overview
over what we're doing here and why.

## Roles

### Users
Users are people who use community wireless networks and have one or two
nodes they are responsible for. If they want to have a node, they are asked
to sign up through the dashboard and will then be able to create and manage
their nodes. They have little to no knowledge of the technologies and
terminologies that underly the network.

### Power-Users/Mentors

Power-Users maintain multiple nodes and also help new Users to get set up
and ready within the network. They take care of the network as a whole and
want to figure out where things are not working and what can be done to fix
it.

### Administrators
Administrators are people who are trusted by the community and take care
for crucial parts of the infrastructure. They are highly technically
skilled or have long experience with building wireless networks.
