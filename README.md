Dashboard for the nodeDB

Concepts
========

The Dashboard is a single-page app built on Backbone and Mustache as
templating - it uses the nodeDB RestAPI to make essential configurations
possible.


Requirements
============

Please install bootstrap from http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/
Be sure to download the full source (including javascripts)
Bootstrap must reside in the subdirectory "bootstrap/"

The dashboard also makes use of the nice icons from AwesomeFont: 
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
FontAwesome must reside in the subdirectory "FontAwesome/"
